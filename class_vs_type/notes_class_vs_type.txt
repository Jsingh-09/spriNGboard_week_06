Notes Type vs Class:

1. LINE1  Declares a variable x and initializes it's value to "Hello"
   LINE2  Creates a reference variable rx of string type and sets that to variable x   LINE3  Creates a constant reference variable crx of string type and sets that to
          x as well.

2. The outputs results in the same memory address for all the values. Since they
   are all set to the variable x and will have the same memory address. There is 
   only one string object being created in this program which is variable x.

3. The reason LINE 6 causes an error because crx was a constant reference and
   modifying a constant will always cause an error since that is not possible
   and compiler will show an error while compiling the code.
