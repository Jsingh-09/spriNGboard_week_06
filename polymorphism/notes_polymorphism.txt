Notes on Polymorphism:

1. The output prints two statements "moo" and "Ooof - I ate too much" which are
   implemented in the two classes cow and fullcow which inherited from 'Animal'
   and override of the make_sound() function to print "moo". For the second print
   statement which inherits from 'Cow' and overrides the make_sound() fucntion
   to print "oof- I ate too much"

2. FullCow still able to override Cow's make_sound() method because it's inheriting
   make_sound() from the base class Cow which is inherited from Animal.

3. Final keyword to Cow's make_sound() makes the compiler to complaining beacuse
   the keyword final cuts the inheritance. In other words the specific function 
   cannot be overidden futher in the code.
