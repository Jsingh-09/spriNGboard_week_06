Notes on Slicing:

1. The output shows "moo", "moo" and "I don't know how to amke a sound!". The 
   output seems to input moo twice one for the c object for class cow and another
   one that is a reference cr to class Animal which is the base class. The last one
   is also equal to c but it is passed by value instead of pass by reference 
   compare to object cr. While doing reserach passing by reference or pointer can 
   lead to no slicing at all but passing by value will lead to slicing since object
   is sliced off and tends to get lost.
